# mcscriptStudio
This is mostly a test right now, but it should eventually become a nice interface to compile mcscript.

Goals for creation:
Use codemirror for syntax highlighting and such DONE MOSTLY.
Use jszip for downloading NOT QUITE THERE
Use JSON stringify for json file downloads and loading files. DONE the loading
requirejs for the loading of modules and such, very important DONE BASICALLY
jquery for nice looking things. needing that slidy slide for the compiled vs MOSTLY DONE

considering:
specific fonts for the project.
icon set for the font.

Todo in order:
general website layout
codemirror beside potential file layouts


File Tree List w/ objects and dynamic scripting. ALMOST FINISHED
polish needed for the above:
dont reload the whole file display when a new file is added or deleted.


for ui:
menu should have ⇑ and ⇓ for export and import respectivly NOT THERE YET
