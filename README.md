# mcscriptStudio
This is mostly a test right now, but it should eventually become a nice interface to compile mcscript.

Goals for creation:
Use codemirror for syntax highlighting and such
Use jszip for downloading
Use JSON stringify for json file downloads and loading files.
requirejs for the loading of modules and such, very important

considering:
specific fonts for the project.
icon set for the font.
