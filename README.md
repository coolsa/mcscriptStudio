# mcscriptStudio
A processor for Minecraft Script

Heavily inspired by [commandstudio](commandstudio.github.io/commandstudio/) by [lemarcantoine](https://github.com/lemarcantoine), [MCSEditor](https://pandawanfr.github.io/MCSEditor/) by [PandawanFr](https://github.com/PandawanFr/), and is based off of [dumb_test_1](https://github.com/coolsa/dumb_test_1) and [dumb_test_2](https://github.com/coolsa/dumb_test_2).

This project is a work that has been in development since the first commit of dumb_test_1, back in may of 2017. This has been a year long project! wowzers!
