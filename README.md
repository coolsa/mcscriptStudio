# mcscriptStudio
This is mostly a test right now, but it should eventually become a nice interface to compile mcscript.

Goals for creation:
Use codemirror for syntax highlighting and such
Use jszip for downloading
Use JSON stringify for json file downloads and loading files.
requirejs for the loading of modules and such, very important
jquery for nice looking things. needing that slidy slide for the compiled vs

considering:
specific fonts for the project.
icon set for the font.

Todo in order:
general website layout
codemirror beside potential file layouts


File Tree List w/ objects and dynamic scripting.


for ui:
menu should have ⇑ and ⇓ for export and import respectivly
⮡ for the file dropdowns
ex:
file
folder/
⮡file
⮡folder/
  ⮡file
⮡file
file
